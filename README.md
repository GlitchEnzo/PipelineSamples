# Pipeline Samples
Sample projects for [Pipeline](http://pipeline.graphics/)

### ComputeAdder

A Compute Shader that takes two input buffers of floats, adds them together, and stores them in a result buffer. The result buffer is read-back every frame, so the results are updated in real-time with any changes to the input buffers.

### MovingTriangle

A single triangle that uses a constant buffer with time to move from the left of the screen to the right and warp back.

### SimpleMeshShader

A single static triangle rendered using a Mesh Shader instead of a Vertex Shader.

### SimpleTriangle

The traditional "Hello World" for compute graphics. A single static triangle with Red, Green, and Blue vertices.
